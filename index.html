                <b>India in Olympics</b> <i> - 1 August '21</i>

                According to the website <a href=" https://qz.com/2040225/by-population-these-countries-have-the-highest-olympic-medal-count/">Quartz</a>, an article was published correlating between the medal tally at Olympics and the population of the country; which the common audience would concur a direct proportionality that if the country has a larger population then the medal tally would be high as well. If you think in those terms then you are 1/3rd wrong. The United States and China have been performing as per their might but the second most populous nation in the world is absent from the list. For the 2020 Olympics at Tokyo, the country of New Zealand with a population of 5,100,000+ has a medal count of 11 and the country of Czech Republic, formed in 1993 after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, has a medal count of 7 with a population of 10,000,000+.

                Talking about India, it begs and begs the question as to what is the reason that a 74 year old country that dominates the workforce sphere, that orchestrates the political landscape of its own states and the largest demoractic nation cannot produce the talent that can achieve a single gold medal. The only gold that India has bagged as an Individual Contributor was by Abhinav Bhindra in the <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhinav_Bindra#Summer_Olympics">2008 Olympics </a>. There is a shift in the mindset of the people to make the youth get into sports and arts apart from the usual academic pressures but this marginal change is a stepping stone, but not good enough. The stereotypical uncles and aunties of the parties talk about how this generation does not honor India in the global sporting stage but the next contrary moment is to shut the kids from waking up 7am in the morning to go to cricket/football/badminton practice because they need to understand the philosophy of academics, the sciences and the might of English language before anything else. They will praise a movie where the athletic protagonist will work towards his/her goal despite the avalanche of misery, obstacles and hurdles faced but would not listen to the hearts of their own youth when they ask for the same spark from them, the same support, the same compassion and the same pride.

                I am not saying that kids should have their whole attention span diverted in one direction but there are different branches in a tree and the fruits will bear in all of them. This would only happen if the tree is nurtured while it grows and if it flourishes in it's own environment with the right push at the right time. Children are impressionable and people are reluctant to change their opinion about how there is a paradigm shift as the generation progresses. For kids, it is staple now to watch iPad while they eat and this change is here to stay no matter how hard of a pill it is to swallow.
